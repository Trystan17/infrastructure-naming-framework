# Core Infrastructure Bundle

## Overview

The Core Infrastructure Bundle represents foundational services and components
required for any enterprise-grade system.  
It forms the base layer on which all other bundles rely.

---

## Purpose

- Provide a stable foundation for system architecture  
- Enable interoperability between all other bundles  
- Define reusable patterns for subdomains and components  

---

## Generic Structure

---

## Principles

1. Functional clarity – each subdomain has a clear role  
2. Reusability across other bundles  
3. Scalable design  
4. Consistent naming conventions  
5. Licensing awareness for commercial use

## Licensing Note

All proprietary names, subdomains, and bundles in this framework are **fully owned by the repository owner**.  
Commercial use requires a **separate licensing agreement**.
