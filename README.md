# QNS Infrastructure Naming Framework

## Overview

This repository presents a curated **infrastructure naming framework**  in Quilibrium Names Service (QNS) designed for
enterprise-grade systems, distributed networks, blockchain protocols, and cloud-native architectures.

The framework focuses on **clarity, scalability, and long-term architectural consistency**.
It is intended as a reference layer for teams designing complex technical systems.

This is not a branding exercise.
It is a **structural naming foundation for infrastructure**.

## Why Infrastructure Naming Matters

In large-scale systems, naming is not cosmetic — it is architectural.

Clear and consistent naming enables:
- Scalable system design
- Operational clarity
- Governance and security enforcement
- Cross-team coordination
- Long-term maintainability

Poor naming decisions create technical debt.
This framework aims to prevent that.

---

## Scope of the Framework

The naming framework covers the following infrastructure domains:

- Core Network Architecture
- Routing & Traffic Flow
- Security, Trust & Identity
- Governance & Policy Enforcement
- Observability & Monitoring
- Orchestration & Deployment
- Access & Identity
- Resilience & Availability
- Compute & Performance
- Modular & Layered Architecture

Each domain is documented as a **coherent naming bundle**.

---

## Design Principles
This framework follows strict principles:
- Names describe function, not branding
- Names remain reusable across layers
- Clear separation between control, data, and governance planes
- Compatibility with long-term system evolution
- Neutral, technology-agnostic terminology
